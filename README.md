Quick answer : 
![Open Source](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/30512349/open-source.jpg)


~~Boring answer~~ :smirk: Long answer :
- **We're about community and participation**
> Programmers are smart but not very good at putting that across to people who arent as "smart". In todays world communication is important, be it verbal or written. We hope to impart such skills in our members. This is made easier by interaction with each other.


- **We're a platform for growth**
> n + 1 brains are better than n, there exists an undeniable strength in unity. Every idea is useful and every opinion matters. We're here to show what can be achieved when people work together!


- **We're about open source, and its numerous benefits.**
> We believe in the power of open source and the good. New to the concept check [this](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) out.


- **Providing a platform to collaborate at scale**
> Software develoment isn't just fibonacci series and fancy star patterns. It's a beautiful process and we feel everyone should get a chance to experience it in its true form!
